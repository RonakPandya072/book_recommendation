Recommender systems are a powerful new technology for extracting additional value for a business from its user databases. Recommender systems benefit users by enabling them to find items they like. Conversely, they help the business by generating more sales. The main objective is to create a recommendation system to recommend relevant books to users based on popularity and user interest. A streamlit-based API is created that gives simple book recommendations (content-based filtering). Visit the web app: https://book-recommendation-system7.herokuapp.com/
